            <h3>The Hare and the Tortoise</h3>
            <p>
                There was once a hare who was friends with a tortoise. One day, he challenged the tortoise to a race.
                Seeing
                how slow the tortoise was going, the hare thought heâ€™ll win this easily. So he took a nap while the
                tortoise
                kept on going. When the hare woke up, he saw that the tortoise was already at the finish line. Much to
                his
                chagrin, the tortoise won the race while he was busy sleeping.</p>
