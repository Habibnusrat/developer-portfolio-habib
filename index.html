            <h3>The Hare and the Tortoise</h3>
            <p>
                There was once a hare who was friends with a tortoise. One day, he challenged the tortoise to a race.
                Seeing
                how slow the tortoise was going, the hare thought he’ll win this easily. So he took a nap while the
                tortoise
                kept on going. When the hare woke up, he saw that the tortoise was already at the finish line. Much to
                his
                chagrin, the tortoise won the race while he was busy sleeping.</p>

            <h3>Midas and the Golden touch</h3>
            <p>
                The story of Midas is another classic bedtime tale for kids. This ancient story from Greece describes
                King Midas as a greedy and discontented man, who loved gold more than anything else. Once, he did a good
                deed for someone, and a Greek God appeared before him, saying that he will be granted his heart’s desire
                for doing the good deed. Midas wished that everything he touched should turn into gold, instantly. The
                God granted his wish. Midas was very excited and went about touching random objects, turning everything
                he touched into gold. After a while, he became hungry. However, when he touched his food, it turned to
                gold, and he could not eat it. He was starving and dismayed that he could not eat. Seeing him troubled,
                his loving daughter threw her arms around him to comfort him, and she, too, turned to gold. Midas was
                horrified that his daughter had become a statue of gold. He regretted asking for the Golden Touch and
                realised that he had been greedy and that gold was not the most precious thing in the world. He cried
                and begged the God to take back his wish. The God took pity on him and asked him to take a dip in the
                river by his palace, and then fill a pitcher of water from the river and sprinkle it on all the things
                he wanted to change back. He followed the instructions and changed his daughter back to normal. He was
                very happy to get his beloved daughter back and stopped being greedy from that moment.</p>
